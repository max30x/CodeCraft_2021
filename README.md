## CodeCraft_2021
There is some code obviously.And it's runnable.If you run these code,with the proper input,
it seems like that it will help you decide where to put vms.It's helpful if you aren't lack of
money right now...Maybe the code itself not looks that good...
Also,3000 is too small in some case.Could be a bug sometimes.
